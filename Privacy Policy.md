#### 3. Automatic Data Collection and Advertising



In our applications we may ask you to submit and we may process other non-personally identifiable information that may be private to you such as your age range, year of birth and gender, provided that year of birth and gender are collected solely for users who identify themselves in our apps as above the age of 13. We will use such information to personalize the content of the app. For users who identify themselves as above the age of 13 and have not opted out from behavioral advertising, we may use such information to display targeted ads. You can opt out from receiving targeted ads by choosing one of the options described in the ''Opt Out'' Section of our Privacy Policy.



We may work with analytics companies to help us understand how our apps and games are being used, such as the frequency and duration of usage. We work with advertisers and third party advertising networks, who need to know how you interact with advertising provided in our services which help us keep the applications free. Advertisers and advertising networks use some of the information collected by the our services, including, but not limited to, the unique identification ID of your mobile device and your mobile telephone number. To protect the anonymity of this information, we use an encryption technology to help ensure that these third parties can’t identify you personally. These third parties may also obtain anonymous information about other applications you’ve downloaded to your mobile device, the mobile websites you visit, your non-precise location information (e.g., your zip code), and other non- precise location information in order to help analyze and serve anonymous targeted advertising in our apps and elsewhere. We may also share encrypted versions of information you have provided in order to enable our partners to append other available information about you for analysis or advertising related use.



We will pass the device-level data (e.g. if a device has clicked on a sports ad within our apps) and we may pass age & gender information to our advertising partners who may reuse such data for targeted advertising. We allow our partners to serve targeted third party advertisements or other content. They may attach the information gathered from your application to info gathered from other apps, websites, or via other services, and then build profiles and transfer the info to another provider. For instance, we may pass advertising IDs to Facebook and they match it with your Facebook ID, aggregate it and delete the initial identifier. By doing so, the other provider may receive or gather information about you and use the information for displaying targeted ads. Advertisers may choose their audience by location, demographics, likes, keywords, age & gender, interests, behaviors, connections and any other information Facebook receives or infers about users. We cooperate with several providers of IBA that are listed herein in the subsection "Advertising Companies".



#### 4. Routine erasure and blocking of personal data



The data controller shall process and store the personal data of the data subject only for the period necessary to achieve the purpose of storage, or as far as this is granted by the European legislator or other legislators in laws or regulations to which the controller is subject to.

If the storage purpose is not applicable, or if a storage period prescribed by the European legislator or another competent legislator expires, the personal data are routinely blocked or erased in accordance with legal requirements.



#### 5. Rights of the data subject



We collect only anonymous information for the purposes of targeted advertising and tracking of user behavior within the game. Should the user wish to eliminate the right to access to this automatically collected information, he or she can turn off individual device tracking on his or her portable device.
